    "text": "“I am a first year Master’s student at the University of New Hampshire studying how we can use acoustic methods to monitor bat populations over time!”\n\n\nMy goal is to become a state or federal bat biologist.\n\n\n\nI graduated from UConn in 2023 with a Bachelor’s in natural resources concentrating in fisheries and wildlife conservation.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from UConn, I worked on various research projects as a wildlife technician with CT Dept. of Energy and Environmental Protection. My bat conservation skills include mist netting and harp trapping, bat handling, bat identification in hand and using acoustic analysis, radio transmittering and tracking bats through the landscape, and taking biological measurements and samples such as wing biopsies, buccal swabs, wing swabs, and estimating WNS scarring on affected species.\nThanks for checking out my web site!"
